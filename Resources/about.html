        DEBSOC is a registered society in Chitkara university operational since April 2021, Over the course of last year we have organised over 30 debates with active participation from our 90+ members. As the Debating society we seek to find answers to modern day problems & create a platform for ideas & next gen thinkers who like to research,discuss themes relevant to students and the modern world. We are building a community of like minded individuals discussing a plethora of genres; Politics, Law, Science, Philosophy, Art, Business, Economics and much more.
